# Security Policy

## Prologue

Authelia takes security very seriously. We follow the rule of
[responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), and we urge our community to do so as
well instead of making the vulnerability public. This allows time for the security issue to be patched quickly.

If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please first contact one of the maintainers privately  as described in the
[contact options](#contact-options) below.

We urge you not to disclose the bug publicly at least until we've had a
reasonable chance to fix it, and to clearly communicate any public disclosure timeline in your initial contact with us.
If you do not have a particular public disclosure timeline, we will clearly communicate ours as we publish security
advisories.

For more information about [security](https://www.authelia.com/information/security/) related matters, please read
[the documentation](https://www.authelia.com/information/security/).

## Contact Options

Several [contact options](README.md#contact-options) exist, it's important to make sure you contact the maintainers
privately which is described in each available contact method. The methods include our [security email](README.md#security),
[Matrix](README.md#matrix), and [Discord](README.md#discord).

## Credit

Users who report bugs will optionally be credited for the discovery. Both in the [security advisory] and in our
[all contributors](README.md#contribute) configuration/documentation.

## Process

1. User privately reports a potential vulnerability.
2. The core team reviews the report and ascertain if additional information is required.
3. The core team reproduces the bug.
4. The bug is patched, and if possible the user reporting te bug is given access to a fixed version or git patch.
5. The fix is confirmed to resolve the vulnerability.
6. The fix is released.
7. The [security advisory] is published sometime after users have had a chance to update.

## Help Wanted
